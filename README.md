#Memory Game

##Description

This memory game is built with HTML, CSS and Vanilla Script. The game objective is for the user to find all the matches before the time runs out.  When the user clicks a card it flips over to reveal the other side. After 2 cards are chosen, if the cards are match they will be locked face up and if they are not a match they will flip back over. If the user find all the matches before the time is up, they win the game, if they lose they have the option to try again.

##Roadmap
1. Implementing a score function which calculates a score based on how quickly the user found all the matches and saving a high score. 
2. Adding a cards array, in order to add options for different themes and levels.
3. Improve styling for responsiveness and optimal user experience.
